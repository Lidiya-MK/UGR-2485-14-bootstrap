        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p> 
            AI, especially the realm of machine learning, captivates me with its limitless potential to transform our world. Witnessing how AI reshapes industries, from healthcare to finance, fuels my passion to contribute meaningfully in this landscape. For the reader, here is the definition of machine learning and artifical intelligence.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt> Machine learning</dt>
                <dd>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating algorithms and systems that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</dd>
                <dt> Artifical Intelligence</dt>
                <dd>
                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>I am particularly interested in machine learning because it is the most important aspect to determine how an AI system will function</p>

        <h2>Neuroscience</h2>
        <p>After coming across Dr Andrew Huberman I have come to love the world of neuroscience. "Neuroscience" refers to the scientific study of the nervous system, including its structure, function, development, and its relationship to behavior and cognition. It is also heavily intertwined with psychology. Which is another inerest of mine </p>

        <h2> Cognitive Psychology</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been good at understanding peoples emotions and the source of their habits. I would like to make a career out of this skill through studying cognitive psychology. Which is a branch of psychology that focuses on studying mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, problem-solving, language, and decision-making. It explores how people acquire, process, store, and use information.

    <h2>Stoicism</h2>
    <p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated in ancient Greece, later developed in Rome, and remains influential in modern times. It teaches principles and practices aimed at achieving inner tranquility, resilience, and a virtuous life, regardless of external circumstances. I for one want to achieve those things and reading the works of the stoics has helped me become a better person in addition to my belief in God. I entend to study the works of the stoics intensly in my lifetime.  </p>
